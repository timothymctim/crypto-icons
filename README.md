Crypto Icons
============
A collection of hand-made Scalable Vector Graphics icons, useful for
representing cryptographic schemes and protocols or to create figures
explaining something in cryptography.
The icons can be freely used in any presentation or publication **even
without** acknowledgment/attribution.

Naming convention
-----------------
I choose to use descriptive naming for the icons and not to use
metaphors.
For example, the padlock icon is called `padlock` and not `encryption`
or `ciphertext`.
Although most icons have a clear use, some might look less useful.
The following list describes some icons and how one could use them.

* `exclamation-mark`: sensitive data, in need of protection
* `document-arrows`: a document being shared
* `shuffle`: a mix in a mix network
